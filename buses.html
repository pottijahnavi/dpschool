  The beginning of the 21st century would introduce extensive changes to the production of school buses. Though vehicle assembly saw few direct changes, manufacturer consolidation and industry contraction effectively ended the practice of customers selecting body and chassis manufacturers independently. While the aspect of customer choice was largely ended (as a result of corporate ownership and supply agreements), decreased complexity paved the way for new product innovations previously thought impossible. During the 2010s, while diesel engines have remained the primary source of power, manufacturers expanded the availability of alternative-fuel vehicles, including CNG, propane, gasoline, and electric-power buses.Buses reduce traffic. Suppose the elementary school closest to your house serves about 500 students. Can you imagine what the surrounding roads would look like at 8 am if a few hundred parents drove there separately, all trying to get to the school to drop off their children? In fact, each school bus removes an average of 36 cars from the roads.Buses reduce pollution. When you calculate how many cars are removed from the roads by school bus ridership, it equates to over one billion pounds of CO2 emissions per year for just one of the 50 states. That amounts to a massive impact on the environment over time.Buses reduce traffic. Suppose the elementary school closest to your house serves about 500 students.
